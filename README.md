# Design Principles and Patterns in .NET 8

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the application of the SOLID principles and the Builder pattern using .NET 8. These principles and patterns are fundamental for creating clean, maintainable, and scalable software.

## SOLID Principles
The SOLID principles are a set of design guidelines that help developers create robust and flexible code.

### Principles:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - A class should have only one reason to change.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

Each principle is implemented with examples in .NET 8, showcasing best practices and real-world use cases.

## Builder Pattern
The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, enabling the same construction process to create different representations.

### Example:
In this repository, the Builder pattern is demonstrated by creating:
- A fluent builder for constructing objects step by step.
- A practical implementation of the pattern to construct complex domain objects in a .NET 8 project.

## Usage
To explore the examples:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/URockD/DesignPatterns.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your favorite .NET 8-compatible IDE (e.g., Visual Studio 2022, Rider, or Visual Studio Code).
3. Navigate to the SOLID principles or Builder pattern folder and build/run the examples.
